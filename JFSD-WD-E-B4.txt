What is Java Full Stack 
	Front End -> user sees
	Back End -> which runs 24 * 7 -> processing of data, connects to database(SQL, No SQL)
	API -> bridge 


Why Java -> Platform independent, 
			develop web, desktop, mobile
			OOPS -> Object Oriented Programming Language

JVM, JDK, JRE -> Name.java

	Java Virtual Machine -> load, verify, execute code and provides run time env

	Java Runtime Environment  -> implementation of JVM -> libraries + files --> Sun Microsystems

	Java Development Kit -> javac, java etc + JRE + some supporting jars

Java Enhancement Proposal -> JEP
			java 6 -> 2006 , java 7 : 2011., java 8 : 2014, java 9 : 2017
			LTS : Long Term Support Versions -> 8, 11, 17, 21 (current lts version)
			every six months in march and september -> minor versions, non-lts versions

			Back ward compatability..

Install JDK : Open JDK , Oracle JDK, Amazon Coretto JDK..

		Edit environment variables(installed JDK) and edit path (bin)
		cmd -> check java -version		

Install IDE : Integrated Development environment 
		Eclipse, NetBeans, STS, IntelliJ (community - free source, ultimate - paid version)

Configure a folder in IntelliJ
	-> New Project -> created a project with IntelliJ System, add/select JDK
	-> packages -> group of classes
	-> .java extension
	-> Class : Blue print -> objects, methods/functions, refer to another class, variables
		Objects : attributes -> weight, color -> characterstics
				  methods -> actions your perform : drive, applyBrake, soundHorn
				  constructors -> creating and initializing objects

Naming Conventions :
	camelcase : 
		Class Names : UniversityServiceImplementation .. connEctioexception
		method/function, Object Names : applyBrake

	Compilation Error : When you code, you will see errors	
		through cmd : javac HelloWorld.java

	Run Time Errors : When you execute code, you will see errors
		run through cmd : java HelloWorld.java


	Main : public static void main(String[] args){
			public -> access modifier
			static -> key word
			void -> return type
			main -> name of the Method
			String[] args -> input parameters/method signature.. Array of String arguments
	}

	From static methods you can't refer non-static variables or methods directly
		Create an object for class, from object you can refer non-static attributes in static methods


	Comments :
		    /* comment
   			 * something */

			//    comment	

Object Creation :

	NameOfClass objName = new NameOfClass();
	create any number of objects for a class
	name of object in a method should be unique

A method inside a method -> compilation error


Task :

Create a class `Student` with a non-static variable `studentId` and a static variable `universityName`. 
Write methods to display `studentId` and `universityName`, 
and a static method to update `universityName`.
In the `main` method of `Student`, create two `Student` objects, assign different `studentId` values, display their details, update `universityName` using the static method, and display the details again. 
Observe how the change in `universityName` affects both objects.

	1. primitive Data Types : Stores simple values directly in memory 
		byte : 8-bit (-128 to 127)
		short : 16-bit
		int : 32-bit
		long : 64-bit
		float : 32-bit , floating point number (single precision)
		double : 64-bit, floating point number (double precision)
		char : 16-bit unicode charcter, single alphabet
		boolean : true or false

	2. Non-Primitive Data Types or Reference Data types : store references to objects(memory address)

		String : sequence of characters (number, alphabet, spcl charcters)
		Arrays : group -> collection of elements of same data type
		Class : blue-print of objects
		Interfaces : set of methods which class implement
		Enumerator .. Enum : represent fixed set of constants

	3. Wrapper classes: wraps around primitive data types : Objects
		a. When you work with Collection of Objects
		b. Generics
		c. autoboxing -> primitive to wrapper and vice-versa -> unboxing
		d. Data Conversion : Type Casting
		c. to store null values
		e. Serialization : conversion of objects to byte stream

instanceof -> objectName instanceof DataType/ClassName -> true	

toString -> can't NPE
String.valueof() -> handle NPE

		Integer myInt = null;
        Integer.valueOf(myInt);
        myInt.intValue();	

//byte < short < char < int < long < float < double

narrow -> Manual Cast
and wide casting -> automatic casting

Variables :
	Local or Instance : Scope is limited to method
	Global : scope is limited to Class		

Literals : Values assigned to variables

Identifiers : names you give to variables, methods, classes, packages

KeyWords : predefined functionality and they can't be identifiers

Operators : perform some calculations/operation on variables or values

	Arithmetic Operators : Basic Math : + , -, *, /, %(modulus), ++, --
		++a -> PreIncrement
		a++ -> PostIncrement

1)++Post-Increment (a++):++we use a++ in our statement if we want to use the current value, and then we want to increment the value of ++a by 1.
2)Pre-Increment(++a): We use ++a in our statement if we want to increment the value of ++a by 1 and then use it in our statement.

	Assignment Operators -> =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=
		int a = 6 
		a += 5; --> a = a(6) + 5 => 11
	Comparison Operators/Relational Operators -> ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
	Logical Operators : &&, ||, !
		&& -> If one statement is false, result will be false
		|| -> If one statement is true, result will be true
	Bitwise Operators &, |, ^, ~, <<(Signed left shift), >>(Signed right shift), >>>(Unsigned right)
	Unary Operators :  ++, -- (Pre and Post), 
			Unary plus , 
			unary minus, unary !
	InstanceOf Operator : instanceof
	
	Ternary Operator ?
		condition ? expression1 : expression2
			condition == true then expression1 will be executed
			condition == false then expression2 will be executed

Conditional Statements : if, if-else, if-else-if, nested if
	Scanner -> take input from user
	Debug your code -> put breakpoints, start in debug mode

Switch Statement : switch, case, break
	When you have to check multiple conditions, instead of "if", we can use Switch

Loops : for, for-each/enhanced for -> Collections, nested for, infinite-for loop
		If you want to execute a piece of code many times until the condition is satisfied
			for loop :
	 	for(initialize a variable; condition; increment/decrement.. post or pre operator)
		nested for loop : loop inside loop 

		while : repetetive block of code execution as long as condition is true, 
		do while : atleast once, execute code irrespective condition
		infinite loop using while

jump statements -> break, continue, return
